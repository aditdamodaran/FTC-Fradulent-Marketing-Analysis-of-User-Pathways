Structure of Repository:
* 33 contains user_csvs, which are browsing histories for each "duped" user in separate CSV files--contains fake news references and non-fake news references

* read.py should contain all methods and functions for reading the all_data from its original csv file

*read_raw.py reads the raw month data file and outputs a PKL file that is more manageable
